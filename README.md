# wordpress-install-script
Script to download, unzip, move and set permissions on wordpress.

You need to create a folder that you want the wordpress site setup in, Download and run the script.sh from that folder.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04. I wrote this becuase I have been moving a bunch of websites from shared hosting to various VPS's. 

This script allows me to save time. 

Any questions
